#Shipping the Empty Box:
***Releasing `[string:titleOfGame]` on `[array:platforms]`***

*A lecture by [John "Seg" Seggerson](http://theseg.github.io/).*

> Working on `[string:titleOfGame]`, you need to release it on `[array:platforms-0]` and perhaps on `[array:platforms-1]` in the future. You have `[int:NULL]` time till release. Build engineer and programmer John "Seg" Seggerson (Telltale Games, John McNeil Studio, Dominique Pamplemousse) will help smooth the multi-platform release by outlining build engineering tips for platforms on desktop, mobile, console, and beyond. Increase artist, writer, and programmer efficiency with a set of core specifications and planning applied to existing platforms and future platforms. Skills and knowledge that will reduce release headaches for your `[int:sizeOfTeam]` team!
